# Example 8
## What it does
The example demonstrates how to load a descriptor from a file and to compare two descriptors.

## Prerequisites
*As said in the introduction page, this repository doesn't provide SDK headers, libraries and tools;
you have to obtain them from VisionLabs.*

This example assumes that you have read the **FaceEngine Handbook** already
(or at least have it somewhere nearby for reference) and are familar with some core concepts,
like memory management, object ownership and life-time control. This sample will not explain
these aspects in detail.

## Example walkthrough
To get familiar with FSDK usage and common practices, please go through Example 1 first.

## How to run
./Example8 <descriptor1.xpk> <descriptor2.xpk> threshold

## Example output
```
These persons look the same.
