# Example 5
## What it does
This example demonstrates how to use the qt library to processing images of different
formats by example the MTCNN detector and MTCNN feature set and to estimate a face quality
on an image and to detect attributes on an face.

## Prerequisites
*As said in the introduction page, this repository doesn't provide SDK headers, libraries and tools;
you have to obtain them from VisionLabs.*

This example assumes that you have read the **FaceEngine Handbook** already
(or at least have it somewhere nearby for reference) and know some core concepts,
like memory management, object ownership and life-time control. This sample will not explain
these aspects in detail.

More detailed information about the qt library can be obtained by clicking on the link https://www.qt.io/.

## Example walkthrough
To get familiar with FSDK usage and common practices, please go through Example 1 first.

## How to run
./Example5 <some_image>

## Example output
Warped images with faces, image with face detection and marked detection points.
