# Example 3
## What it does
This example demonstrates how to use the MTCNN detector and MTCNN feature set and to estimate a face quality on an image and to detect attributes on an face.

## Prerequisites
*As said in the introduction page, this repository doesn't provide SDK headers, libraries and tools; you have to obtain them from VisionLabs.*

This example assumes that you have read the **FaceEngine Handbook** already (or at least have it somewhere nearby for reference) and are familar with some core concepts, like memory management, object ownership and life-time control. This sample will not explain these aspects in detail.

## Example walkthrough
To get familiar with FSDK usage and common practices, please go through Example 1 first.

## How to run
./Example3 <some_image.ppm>
