# Example 2
## What it does
This example demonstrates how to estimate a face quality on an image and to detect attributes on a face.

## Prerequisites
*As said in the introduction page, this repository doesn't provide SDK headers, libraries and tools;
you have to obtain them from VisionLabs.*

This example assumes that you have read the **FaceEngine Handbook** already (or at least have it
somewhere nearby for reference) and are familiar with some core concepts, like memory management,
object ownership and life-time control. This sample will not explain these aspects in detail.

## Example walkthrough
To get familiar with FSDK usage and common practices, please go through Example 1 first.

## How to run
./Example2 <some_image.ppm>

## Example output
Warped images with faces.
