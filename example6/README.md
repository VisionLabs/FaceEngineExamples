# Example 6
## What it does
The example demonstrates how to save a descriptor and descriptor batch to a file.

## Prerequisites
*As said in the introduction page, this repository doesn't provide SDK headers, libraries and tools;
you have to obtain them from VisionLabs.*

This example assumes that you have read the **FaceEngine Handbook** already
(or at least have it somewhere nearby for reference) and are familiar with some core concepts,
like memory management, object ownership and life-time control. This sample will not explain
these aspects in detail.

## Example walkthrough
To get familiar with FSDK usage and common practices, please go through Example 1 first.

## How to run
./Example6 <some_image.ppm>

## Example output
Warped images, descriptors, descriptor batch.
